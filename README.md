# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-Covid-19

The dataset was populated with data such as:
1. User Name
2. Screen Name
3. Location
4. Tweet At
5. Original Tweet
6. Sentiment
   
# Analysis
The dataset had to to be cleaned using EDA and analysed for :
1. Tweet counts by Location
2. Distribution of Sentiment across the Dataset
3. Most Common Positive/ Negative words using Vader Sentiment
4. Word Clouds for Positive/Negative words

# Machine Learning
Predictive classification models wer also used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Random Forest
4. Naive Bayes Classification

# Deep Learning & Hypertunning

Input -> Sequential -> Embedding -> CNN(1) -> CNN(2) -> ... -> CNN(N) -> LSTM -> Dense -> Output

1. Artifical Neural Network (ANN)
2. Convolutional neural network (CNN)
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
4. Long short-term memory (LSTM)

& hypertuned the model to maximise model accuracy.

# Steps
In order to achieve this, required libraries were NLTK, SKlearn, Keras, & Vader. utility libraries like Numpy, Pandas, String & Collections.
Performed EDA on the twitter Dataset.
- Machine learning Algorithms Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, Naive Bayes.
- Perform Exploratory Analysis on dataset to extract vital features before training model.
- Visualise the data using Plot on Sentiment & Location for highest area people tweet from.
- Preprocessing the data for Machine Learning & Plot 20 Most Common words using Vader Sentiment.
- Created 'Positive' & 'Negative' clouds using WorldClouds library.
- ML algorithm training accuracy on Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, Naive Bayes.
- Clean data and extract max features for deep learning algorithms. 
- Deep Learning Analysis using ANN > CNN > RNN > LSTM.
- Increased model accuracy by ~2% using deep learning models through Dense, LSTM layers.
